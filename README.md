Humans are sophisticated living beings who need a clean surrounding to live. 
There are many authorities responsible for this cleaning like municipal corporation etc. 
They get rid of most of the garbage but sometimes people start throwing garbage at unpredictable random spots which are not seen by these authorites and these spots eventually turn into garbage dumps.
Common people usually don't have any access to contact the authorities directly to help this situation.
Therefore, my app is focussed on providing a solution to this problem.
Here, the website can be monitored by the authorities where common people can help to identify these "potential dumps" in early stages.
